  Doctoral Thesis Proposal: "Sacred Bonds and Sexual Selection: An
  Interdisciplinary Analysis of Transpersonal Dimensions in Human Mating Systems
  from Evolutionary Psychology to Jungian Soul Connections
---

# Original Thesis Outline



I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This interdisciplinary dissertation proposes to examine the intersection of evolutionary reproductive strategies, depth psychology, and transpersonal phenomena in human pair bonding. The research integrates empirical findings from evolutionary psychology, sexual physiology, historical demographics, and Jungian analytical psychology to develop a comprehensive framework explaining both macro-level reproductive patterns (such as the Y-chromosome bottleneck and contemporary mating inequality) and micro-level bonding experiences (including synchronicity, participation mystique, and archetypal recognition). The central thesis argues that sustainable human pair bonding operates simultaneously across biological, psychological, archetypal, synchronistic, and psychoid dimensions, and that contemporary reproductive crises stem partially from cultural overemphasis on tactical optimization while neglecting transpersonal elements essential for deep bonding.&#x20;

Estimated Length: 280-300 pages including appendices, bibliography, and index
