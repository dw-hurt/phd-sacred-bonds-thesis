### Quote 16: Sexual Selection as Core Framework
> "Darwin's theory of sexual selection provided a cogent theoretical framework for understanding the major causal processes of the mating strategies of sexually reproducing species— intrasexual competition and preferential mate choice."

**Page:** 1  
**Context:** Opening statement establishing Darwin's theory as foundation  
**Relevance:** Establishes evolutionary psychology as legitimate scientific framework  
**Dimensions:** Biological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.1

### Quote 17: Human Uniqueness in Sexual Selection
> "Unlike many species, however, humans display mutual mate choice and both sexes compete intensely for desirable mates. Moreover, humans are at least somewhat unique in using complex language to deploy courtship tactics."

**Page:** 1  
**Context:** Distinguishing human from non-human sexual selection  
**Relevance:** Shows humans have unique complexity requiring multi-dimensional analysis  
**Dimensions:** Biological, Psychological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.1; Chapter 7, Section 7.1

### Quote 18: Sexual Strategies Theory Core
> "Sexual strategies theory (SST) is anchored in sexual selection theory, but in the human case there are additional complexities that require conceptual and empirical examination... humans have faced two fundamental classes of adaptive problems of mating: (a) exerting fitness-enhancing preferential mate choice, and (b) out-competing rivals for desirable mates."

**Page:** 3  
**Context:** Introducing SST as extension of Darwin  
**Relevance:** "Additional complexities" = opening for psychological, archetypal, transpersonal dimensions  
**Dimensions:** Biological, Psychological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.3

### Quote 19: Investment Variability
> "When applied to humans, the role of sexual selection becomes even more complex due in part to the facultatively variable nature of male and female investment and the multiplicity of mating strategies of both sexes."

**Page:** 4  
**Context:** Explaining human strategic flexibility  
**Relevance:** Flexibility requires conscious choice and psychological integration  
**Dimensions:** Biological, Psychological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.3; Chapter 3, Section 3.2

### Quote 20: Mutual Heavy Investment
> "Both sexes invest heavily in long-term mating contexts; we expect both sexes to be extremely choosy."

**Page:** 6  
**Context:** Explaining why both sexes have strong mate preferences  
**Relevance:** Heavy investment creates foundation for depth relationship  
**Dimensions:** Biological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.4

### Quote 21: Universal Male Youth Preference
> "Empirical studies from well over 50 different cultures, from Brazil to Zambia, show that men strongly prefer youth in long-term mates... This universal sex difference in age preference holds in cultures that are presumptively monogamous such as Poland, as well as those that permit polygyny such as Zambia."

**Page:** 8  
**Context:** Evidence for cross-cultural universality  
**Relevance:** Documents biological reality that must be integrated (not denied)  
**Dimensions:** Biological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.5

### Quote 22: Female Resource Preference
> "Women have evolved a specialized mate preference for men who have both the ability and the willingness to provide resources."

**Page:** 10  
**Context:** Explaining female long-term mate preferences  
**Relevance:** Biological foundation for provider preference - can be confused with archetypal projection  
**Dimensions:** Biological, Archetypal  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.6; Chapter 3, Section 3.3

### Quote 23: Robust Replication
> "Sex differences in desires for sexual variety are among the most robust and well-replicated of all effects in the psychological sciences..."

**Page:** 12  
**Context:** Strength of empirical evidence  
**Relevance:** Can't ignore real biological differences - must integrate consciously  
**Dimensions:** Biological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.7

### Quote 24: Gender-Egalitarian Paradox
> "On some measures, the magnitude [of sex differences] increases in more gender-egalitarian cultures. For example, sex differences in expressed comfort with multiple casual sex partners are higher in Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Iceland than they are in less gender-egalitarian cultures such as Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Swaziland."

**Page:** 13  
**Context:** Unexpected finding that egalitarianism amplifies sex differences  
**Relevance:** Freedom without wisdom traditions amplifies biological patterns - KEY THESIS SUPPORT  
**Dimensions:** Biological, Cultural  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 6, Section 6.4; Chapter 7, Section 7.4

---

### Quote 25: Unconscious Mating Psychology
> "No conscious awareness about origins, nature, or evolved functions of sexual strategies is implied by SST. Nonetheless, humans may possess partial insight into some aspects of sexual strategies either through observation of others or through introspection about the self."

**Page:** 5  
**Context:** SST premise about conscious awareness  
**Relevance:** "Partial insight" = individuation opportunity; bringing unconscious to consciousness  
**Dimensions:** Biological, Psychological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 3, Section 3.1; Chapter 7, Section 7.2

### Quote 26: Love as Universal
> "Love is a human universal (Jankowiak, 1997). Across cultures, people sing love songs, elope with a loved one against the wishes of their parents, and report personal anguish and longing when separated from a loved one."

**Page:** 7  
**Context:** Discussing love as evolved emotion  
**Relevance:** Universal love suggests archetypal and transpersonal dimensions beyond evolutionary function  
**Dimensions:** Biological, Archetypal, Transpersonal  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.8; Chapter 4, Section 4.2; Chapter 5, Section 5.3

### Quote 27: Language-Based Competition
> "Intrasexual competition also takes on a unique form in the human case as a consequence of the evolution of language. Both sexes use language to attract mates, including displays of humor, charm, or verbal prowess. Humans also use language to derogate their rivals, rendering them less attractive to target mates through slings and arrows of insults and character-impugning reputational damage."

**Page:** 22  
**Context:** Discussing unique human forms of mate competition  
**Relevance:** Language = symbolic dimension; competition via symbols = archetypal realm  
**Dimensions:** Biological, Psychological, Archetypal  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.9; Chapter 3, Section 3.4

### Quote 28: Sexual Selection Continues to Bear Fruit
> "Sexual selection theory, initially advanced by Darwin more than 150 years ago, continues to bear scientific fruit in human mating research."

**Page:** 22  
**Context:** Concluding statement on theory's value  
**Relevance:** Establishes evolutionary psychology as ongoing, productive science  
**Dimensions:** Biological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Conclusion; Chapter 7, Section 7.1

### Quote 29: Replication Crisis Survivor
> "In a scientific era of replication crisis, sex differences in the components of human mating strategies are among the most robust and replicable of all findings in the social sciences."

**Page:** 22  
**Context:** Addressing scientific validity concerns  
**Relevance:** Biological dimension is empirically solid - can't be dismissed or "socially constructed away"  
**Dimensions:** Biological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 2, Section 2.7; Chapter 6, Section 6.2

### Quote 30: Sexual Selection Can Override Survival
> "Sexual selection favors traits that lead to mating success and can be favored even if those traits carry some cost to an organism's survival."

**Page:** 2  
**Context:** Explaining peacock's tail paradox  
**Relevance:** Mating is evolutionarily MORE important than survival - supports thesis that bonding is central  
**Dimensions:** Biological  
**Chapter Placement:** Chapter 1, Section 1.3; Chapter 2, Section 2.1
