# Chapter 7: Synchronistic/Acausal Dimension - Reading Notes

## Key Sources
- Limar (2011) - Quantum physics grounding for Jung's synchronicity (4 quotes)
- Jung CW Vol 8 - STILL NEEDED (primary text on synchronicity)

## Arguments to Develop
- Section 7.1: Jung's synchronicity theory (blocked - need Jung primary text)
- Section 7.2: Synchrony-synchronicity bridge (CAN DRAFT NOW with Limar)
- Section 7.3: Physical mechanisms (quantum non-locality)

## Evidence Needed
- Jung, C.G. (1952) "Synchronicity: An Acausal Connecting Principle"
- Mansfield & Spiegelman (1989) - Quantum mechanics and Jungian psychology
- Persinger et al. (2008) - Brain synchrony between separated individuals

## Integration Notes
- Novel contribution: Exploring relationship between measurable physiological synchrony and Jung's acausal synchronicity
- DNA as quantum coherent process (Limar) supports synchrony-synchronicity bridge
