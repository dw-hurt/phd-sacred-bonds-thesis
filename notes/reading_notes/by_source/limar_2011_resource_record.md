## Abstract (Full Text)

One of the most prospective directions of study of C.G. Jung's synchronicity phenomenon is reviewed considering the latest achievements of modern science. The attention is focused mainly on the quantum entanglement and related phenomena – quantum coherence and quantum superposition. It is shown that the quantum non-locality capable of solving the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox represents one of the most adequate physical mechanisms in terms of conformity with Jung's synchronicity hypothesis. An attempt is made on psychophysiological substantiation of synchronicity within the context of molecular biology. An original concept is proposed, stating that biological molecules involved in cell division during mitosis and meiosis, particularly DNA may be considered material carriers of consciousness. This assumption may be formulated on the basis of phenomenology of Jung's analytical psychology.

## Key Arguments Summary

### Main Thesis
Quantum non-locality (particularly as demonstrated in quantum entanglement) provides a physically plausible mechanism for Carl Jung's synchronicity phenomenon. DNA molecules involved in cell division (mitosis and meiosis) may serve as material carriers of consciousness, bridging Jung's phenomenology with molecular biology.

### Supporting Arguments
1. **Quantum Non-Locality**: EPR paradox resolution demonstrates instantaneous correlations across distance without causal connection—analogous to synchronistic meaningful coincidences
2. **Quantum Coherence**: Biological molecules maintain ordered quantum states long enough to participate in consciousness processes
3. **Quantum Superposition**: Multiple quantum states coexist simultaneously until measurement, potentially manifesting as meaningful coincidences
4. **DNA as Psychoid Structure**: Biological molecules provide physical substrate for Jung's "psychoid" realm (neither purely psychic nor purely material)
5. **Empirical Grounding**: Cites experimental studies demonstrating quantum effects in biological systems (photosynthesis, DNA amplification, interpersonal brain synchrony)

### Theoretical Implications
- Consciousness operates via quantum mechanisms, not purely classical neurobiology
- Synchronicity has measurable quantum correlates in living systems
- Unified theory possible spanning psychology, biology, and fundamental physics
- Jung's psychoid concept receives scientific grounding through quantum biology

---

## Methodology

**Type:** Theoretical review and synthesis

**Approach:**
- Literature review spanning quantum physics, molecular biology, and analytical psychology
- Interdisciplinary bridging of Jung-Pauli dialogue with contemporary quantum biology research
- Proposal of novel hypothesis (DNA as consciousness carrier) based on phenomenological and physical evidence
- Citation of empirical studies supporting quantum effects in biological systems

**Data Sources:**
- Jung's analytical psychology writings (secondary sources)
- Quantum physics literature (EPR paradox, quantum entanglement, coherence, superposition)
- Molecular biology studies (DNA, mitosis, meiosis)
- Consciousness studies experimental research
- Transpersonal psychology theoretical frameworks

**Limitations:**
- Primarily theoretical/speculative (not empirical study)
- Central hypothesis (DNA as consciousness carrier) remains unproven
- Mechanism gaps: how quantum processes in DNA generate consciousness not fully explained
- Quantum decoherence problem in warm biological systems not adequately addressed
- No case studies or concrete synchronicity examples analyzed

## Critical Evaluation

### Strengths
1. **Interdisciplinary Rigor**: Engages seriously with quantum physics, molecular biology, and analytical psychology literature
2. **Empirical Grounding**: Cites experimental studies (not just speculation)
3. **Novel Hypothesis**: DNA as consciousness carrier is original contribution
4. **Historical Context**: Properly situates work in Jung-Pauli dialogue
5. **Biological Specificity**: Focuses on concrete processes (mitosis/meiosis) rather than vague "quantum consciousness"
6. **Extensive Bibliography**: 44+ references spanning multiple disciplines
7. **Heuristic Value**: Provides conceptual framework even if unproven

### Limitations
1. **Theoretical Speculation**: Central hypothesis remains empirically unproven
2. **Mechanism Gaps**: Doesn't fully explain *how* quantum processes generate consciousness
3. **Decoherence Problem**: Warm, wet biological systems cause rapid quantum decoherence—not adequately addressed
4. **Scale Problem**: Quantum effects to experiential consciousness is enormous conceptual leap
5. **No Case Studies**: Lacks concrete synchronicity examples analyzed through quantum lens
6. **Reductionism Risk**: May reduce consciousness too narrowly to molecular processes
7. **Verification Challenge**: How to empirically test DNA-consciousness carrier hypothesis?

### Dissertation Usage Guidelines
1. **Cite as Heuristic Framework**: Present Limar as valuable theoretical model, not proven fact
2. **Acknowledge Speculation**: Clearly state hypothesis is unproven when citing
3. **Balance with Empiricism**: Pair with empirical studies (Persinger, Hyland, etc.)
4. **Critical Distance**: Avoid overclaiming quantum explanations for synchronicity
5. **Complementary Approach**: Use alongside (not instead of) phenomenological descriptions of synchronicity
6. **Research Agenda**: Present as opening future research directions, not closing debate
