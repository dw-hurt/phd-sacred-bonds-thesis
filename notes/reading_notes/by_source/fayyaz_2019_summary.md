## Executive Summary

This paper provides a critical analysis of David Buss's Sexual Strategies Theory (SST) while arguing that evolutionary psychology has overemphasized male promiscuity and underestimated the role of monogamy, culture, and emotions in human mating behavior. Fayyaz (2019) presents evidence from anthropology and evolutionary biology suggesting that modern humans (Homo sapiens) evolved toward monogamous pair-bonding, not polygamy, and that cultural factors and romantic love are central to understanding contemporary mating strategies.

**Key Arguments:**
1. **Monogamy as evolutionary norm** - Contrary to SST's emphasis on male short-term mating, biological and anthropological evidence suggests humans evolved toward monogamy
2. **Cultural variation matters** - Mating strategies vary significantly across matriarchal vs. patriarchal societies, Western vs. Eastern cultures
3. **Emotions drive behavior** - Romantic love, jealousy, and commitment emotions are evolutionary adaptations that facilitate long-term pair-bonding
4. **Cooperative mating** - Mating is a cooperative venture requiring compatible strategies from both partners, not independent male/female strategies
5. **SST limitations** - Buss's theory suffers from hasty generalization, ignores cultural context, and treats mating as individual rather than dyadic

## Core Theoretical Framework

### Sexual Strategies Theory (Buss, 1993) - As Presented

**Eight Core Claims:**
1. Lifelong monogamy with single person is not the human norm
2. Mating strategies are context-dependent but governed by different principles for men and women
3. Both sexes have pursued short-term and long-term mating strategies throughout evolutionary history
4. Parental investment levels differ between sexes, affecting strategy preferences
5. Men's reproductive success is constrained by access to fertile women
6. Men face problems of: partner quantity, identifying sexually accessible women, minimizing commitment
7. Women face problems of: identifying men with resources, men willing to invest, men with parenting skills, men able to commit long-term, protective men
8. Different evolved sexual strategies for men and women emerged to solve these problems

### Critical Analysis Framework (Fayyaz, 2019)

**Five Major Critiques:**

1. **Overemphasis on Male Promiscuity**
   - SST contradicts its own stance on long-term mating by rejecting monogamy
   - Evidence shows humans evolved toward monogamy, not away from it
   - Male biological features (smaller testes, lower sperm production) indicate fitness for monogamy, not multi-male/female mating

2. **Ignoring Cooperative Nature of Mating**
   - SST treats male and female strategies independently
   - Mating requires compatible strategies from both partners (dyadic, not individual)
   - Success depends on coordinated teamwork, not separate optimization

3. **Cultural Context Omission**
   - No consideration of cultural variations (matriarchal vs. patriarchal societies)
   - Western bias ignores societies where women have multiple partners (e.g., Mosuo)
   - Polygamy permitted in 82% of cultures but monogamy remains dominant marital arrangement

4. **Emotional Factors Neglected**
   - Romantic love as evolutionary adaptation facilitating monogamy
   - Emotions (love, jealousy, guilt) function as commitment devices
   - Love changes perception of alternative partners, blocking sexual temptations

5. **Hasty Generalization Problem**
   - "Different adaptive problems require different adaptive solutions"
   - No "general solution" exists because there are no "general problems"
   - Theory attempts to "paint everyone with the same brush"

## Evidence for Monogamy Evolution

### Anthropological Evidence

**Prehistoric Monogamy:**
- **Australopithecus afarensis** - Initially polygynous, shifted toward monogamy during Homo erectus era
- **Neanderthals** - Practiced monogamous mating within clans before European migration; males impregnated females and protected them to ensure lineage
- **Homo erectus** - Monogamy as norm to receive extensive reproductive support from kin/clan
- **Homo sapiens** - Evolved to patrilocal mating resulting in social monogamy as environmental adaptation

**Eusocial Evidence:**
- Mating with single male is ancestral for all eight independent eusocial lineages
- Supports inclusive fitness theory prediction that monogamy was critical for eusociality evolution

### Biological Evidence

**Male Reproductive Anatomy:**
Human males have biological features indicating fitness for monogamy:
- Smaller testes with less sperm production
- Slower sperm replacement
- Less vigorous sperm
- Lower sperm quality
- Lower ejaculation rates (compared to chimpanzees)

**Sperm Competition Theory:**
- Men recognize biological limitations in accessing female reproductive capacity
- Monogamy reduces sperm competition pressure
- Evolutionary pressure shifted males toward long-term strategy

### Evolutionary Benefits of Monogamy

**Female Benefits:**
- Obtain benefits unavailable in polygynous arrangements
- Ensure mates do not desert them
- Territorial marking security
- More beneficial to mate with unmated male than compete as secondary wife

**Male Benefits:**
- Raise offspring and ensure survival
- Certainty of paternity
- Caloric/nutrient supply for children (hunting/scavenging)
- Brain size evolution facilitated by male care investment

## Cultural Variations in Mating Systems

### Matriarchal Societies

**Example: Mosuo (Tibetan Buddhists)**
- Women can have multiple sexual partners
- Children belong to mothers
- Biological fathers live with their own mothers
- Children raised by maternal families
- No gender given more importance than other

**Post-Colonial African Societies:**
- Religious influences shifted toward patriarchal structure
- Matriarchal kinship traces through women
- Offspring live in grandmother's house
- Women respected as life-givers

**Key Concept:**
"In matriarchal societies, no one gender is given more importance than the other as both are responsible for bringing life" (p. 78)

### Polygamous Societies

**Prevalence:**
- Polygamy permitted in 82% of cultures
- Relatively high in Muslim communities of West Africa
- Common in Arab nations and some non-Muslim majority countries

**Legal Status:**
- Legal in: South Africa, Egypt, Eritrea, Morocco, Malaysia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Israel
- Considered "outmost offence" in Western cultures
- Mark of high social/economic/political status in Eastern cultures

**Reasons for Polygamy:**
- Religious sanction
- Access to multiple women's reproductive abilities
- Continuing family name
- Early female marriage expanding reproductive duration
- High proportion of single adult males satisfied by relatives' wives

### Western Monogamy Norm

**Cultural Factors:**
- Dominant marital arrangement despite legal polygamy elsewhere
- Polygamy viewed as offense against chastity and marriage (Cannon, 1974)
- Cultural pressures for exclusive pair-bonding
- Legal and religious frameworks enforce monogamy

## Role of Emotions in Mating Behavior

### Historical Philosophical Context

**Ancient Philosophers on Love:**
- **Diotima of Mantinea:** "Universal human desire is not for beauty, but for everlasting goodness and happiness"
- **Aristophanes:** Humans seek mythic wholeness that sex approximates, not just reproduction
- **Blaise Pascal:** "The heart has its reasons which reason know nothing of"

### Emotional Mechanisms as Adaptations

**Multiple Psychological Mechanisms:**
- Mating and reproduction create significant adaptive challenges
- Multiple psychological mechanisms evolved to overcome challenges
- Form many emotions providing solid base for decision-making
- Emotions affect thinking and behavior in social/personal settings

**Key Emotions:**
1. **Love** - Vital in social decision-making
2. **Guilt** - Commitment device influencing decisions for long-term benefits vs. immediate gratification
3. **Jealousy** - Mate retention and guarding mechanism
4. **Fear** - Changes responsiveness to environmental cues
5. **Arousal** - Affects perception of optimal mating strategy

### Love as Evolutionary Adaptation

**Commitment-Device Theory (Frank, 1988):**
- Guilt affects lust to favor long-term benefits over immediate gratification
- Rewards and punishment concept supports commitment
- Precognition (understanding present decisions affect future) prevents settling for short-term encounters

**Romantic Love Functions:**
1. **Motivational force for monogamy** - Drives long-term pair-bonding
2. **Perceptual changes** - "Anyone who claims to be in love is likely to not find anyone else attractive except their own partner"
3. **Commitment maintenance** - Blocks sexual temptations, prevents infidelity
4. **Cognitive biases** - Operate to allow monogamous mating and reduce polygamy likelihood
5. **Conflict prevention** - Even in polygamous cultures, romantic love prevents finding other mates

**Mate Retention Strategies:**
- Historical evidence of competition strategies among ancestors
- Ensure maximum reproductive gains
- Security of offspring
- Certainty of lineage
- Related to sperm competition phenomena

**When Promiscuity Persists:**
- Conflict between partners
- Jealousy and insecurities
- Perceived threat
- Relationship instability

## Sexual Selection Theory (Darwin)

### Two Components

1. **Intrasexual Competition**
   - Competition between members of one sex
   - Loser typically fails to mate
   - Men feel threatened by other men (Buss empirical evidence)

2. **Intersexual Selection (Female Choice)**
   - Members of one sex discriminatory about mating partners
   - Women more selective in mate selection (Buss empirical evidence)

**Support for Buss:**
Darwin's theory supports SST claims about:
- Different cognitive biases in men and women
- Male-male competition
- Female selectivity

## Contemporary Relevance for Dissertation

### Challenges to Evolutionary Psychology Orthodoxy

**For Chapter 1 (Introduction):**
- Demonstrates that evolutionary psychology itself contains internal debates
- Shows need for cultural and emotional perspectives in modern mating crisis
- Provides alternative framework challenging male promiscuity emphasis

**For Chapter 2 (Evolutionary Foundation):**
- Critical analysis of SST shows limitations of adaptationist thinking
- Evidence for evolved monogamy complicates simple "men seek variety" narrative
- Biological evidence (sperm competition, male anatomy) supports monogamy evolution

**For Chapter 3 (Sociological Mismatch):**
- Cultural variation evidence (matriarchal vs. patriarchal, Western vs. Eastern)
- Modern environment may reactivate short-term strategies despite monogamous evolution
- Technology and globalization create cross-cultural mating market conflicts

**For Chapter 9 (Contemporary Mating Crisis):**
- Romantic love as evolved commitment device undermined by modern dating
- Cultural factors (individualism, consumerism) conflict with evolved bonding mechanisms
- "In order to ensure that Homo Sapiens evolved into a civilized society, the mating behavior had to shift towards monogamy instead of polygamy"

### Key Theoretical Contributions

1. **Monogamy as Derived State** - Humans evolved FROM polygamy TO monogamy (opposite of SST assumption)
2. **Cultural Mediation** - Culture doesn't just express evolved strategies, it shapes and constrains them
3. **Emotional Commitment Devices** - Love, guilt, jealousy are adaptations, not byproducts
4. **Cooperative Mating Model** - Dyadic compatibility, not individual optimization
5. **Context-Dependence** - "Mating strategies are context dependent" - environmental and cultural factors matter

## Key Quotes for Chapter 1

**On Evolutionary Psychology Limitations:**
> "Despite Buss's numerous somewhat successful attempts to explain sexual strategies and human sexual behavior, we can easily find limitations in his explanation." (p. 79)

**On Monogamy vs. Promiscuity:**
> "Modern human beings have evolved into monogamous mates; this could be attributed to the biological features of male sexual organs and reproductive behavior." (p. 77)

**On Sperm Competition:**
> "The existence of the human male Sperm Competition suggests that human males recognize his limitation, when it comes to gaining access to the reproductive abilities of a female, specifically because of his biological makeup." (p. 77)

**On Cultural Influence:**
> "As human beings are social beings, it would be necessary to consider how social interactions in different cultures influence the norms of human sexual behavior." (p. 79)

**On Romantic Love:**
> "Romantic love is a motivational force when it comes to monogamy and long-term mating... Cognitive biases operate which allow monogamous mating and reduce the likelihood of infidelity and/or polygamy." (p. 79)

**On Civilizational Evolution:**
> "In order to ensure that Homo Sapiens (i.e. the modern human beings) evolved into a civilized society, the mating behavior had to shift towards monogamy instead of polygamy." (p. 79)

**On Mating as Cooperation:**
> "It is also important to identify the role of emotions and culture, especially when it comes to how people choose their sexual mates. While long-term and short-term strategies may vary, it is important to consider the reproductive activity based on teamwork." (p. 79)

## Final Assessment

**Overall Quality:** Medium-High  
**Theoretical Contribution:** High  
**Empirical Support:** Low  
**Dissertation Relevance:** High  

**Recommendation:** Use as **critical counterpoint** to standard evolutionary psychology narrative. Provides valuable cultural and emotional perspectives missing from Buss. Evidence for monogamy evolution supports dissertation's argument that contemporary crisis stems from mismatch between evolved long-term bonding mechanisms and modern short-term dating environment. However, verify anthropological claims and seek empirical support for key arguments.
