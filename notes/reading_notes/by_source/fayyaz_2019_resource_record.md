## Abstract

Over the course of history, human beings have taken keen interest in the mating activity. The survival of the human species has been dependent on sexual mating and human sexual companionship has played a pivotal role in building societies and establishing social as well as intimate relationships. To overcome the problem of finding a suitable sexual partner, men and women adopt different strategies, based on their roles in the society. This paper discusses the impact of Evolutionary Psychology on Human mating and sexual behavior. David Buss's Sexual Strategies Theory is considered one of the major research programs to investigate how this relationship works. This paper aims to provide an emotional and cultural perspective on how evolutionary psychology has influenced human sexual and mating behaviors. It can be said that Buss's theory, despite being one of its kind, has failed to look at the complete picture. These limitations are due to various reasons; such as over emphasis on the polygamous nature of men, the evaluation of parental investment of both sexes, the problems each of the sexes can solve by using these strategies and how mating is considered an individual activity instead of a cooperative one. The cultural, philosophical and emotional take on the evolution of human sexual behavior brings a fresh and creative outlook.

## Key Arguments and Contributions

### Main Thesis

Buss's Sexual Strategies Theory (SST), while influential, has significant limitations due to:
1. Overemphasis on male promiscuity/polygamy
2. Ignoring evolved monogamy in humans
3. Neglecting cultural variation and mediation
4. Omitting emotional commitment devices (love, guilt, jealousy)
5. Treating mating as individual rather than cooperative activity

### Primary Contributions

1. **Monogamy Evolution Thesis**
   - Humans evolved FROM polygamy TO monogamy
   - Biological evidence (male anatomy, sperm competition)
   - Anthropological evidence (Neanderthals, Homo erectus, Homo sapiens)
   - Contradicts SST's male promiscuity emphasis

2. **Cultural Mediation Framework**
   - 82% of cultures permit polygamy, but monogamy remains dominant
   - Matriarchal vs. patriarchal societies show extreme variation
   - Western vs. Eastern cultural values shape mating norms
   - Culture doesn't just express evolved strategies—it constrains them

3. **Emotional Commitment Devices**
   - Love, guilt, jealousy as evolved mechanisms
   - Romantic love facilitates monogamy
   - Guilt delays gratification for long-term benefits
   - Love changes perception, blocks alternative partners

4. **Cooperative Mating Model**
   - Mating requires compatible strategies from both partners
   - Dyadic teamwork, not individual optimization
   - Success depends on coordination, not separate maximization

5. **Critique of SST Methodology**
   - Hasty generalization ("paint everyone with same brush")
   - "Different adaptive problems require different adaptive solutions"
   - No general solution for no general problems
   - Ignores individual and cultural variation

## Relevance to Dissertation

### Primary Chapters

**Chapter 1: Introduction - Contemporary Mating Crisis**
- Relevance: HIGH
- Uses: Framework for mismatch between evolved monogamy and modern environment
- Key Points:
  - "In order to ensure that Homo Sapiens evolved into a civilized society, the mating behavior had to shift towards monogamy instead of polygamy" (p. 79)
  - Contemporary crisis as de-civilization or reversal of monogamous adaptation
  - Technology may reactivate ancestral short-term strategies

**Chapter 2: Evolutionary Psychology Foundation**
- Relevance: HIGH
- Uses: Critical analysis of SST, limitations of adaptationist thinking
- Key Points:
  - SST as dominant but flawed paradigm
  - Evidence for evolved monogamy complicates "men seek variety" narrative
  - Need for alternative frameworks accounting for variation

**Chapter 3: Sociological Mismatch and Environmental Disruption**
- Relevance: VERY HIGH
- Uses: Cultural variation evidence, modern environment challenges
- Key Points:
  - Matriarchal vs. patriarchal societies (Mosuo example)
  - 82% cultures permit polygamy but monogamy dominant

## Theoretical Framework

### Sexual Strategies Theory (SST) - As Presented

**Eight Core Claims:**
1. Lifelong monogamy with single person not human norm
2. Mating strategies context-dependent, different principles for sexes
3. Both sexes pursued short-term and long-term strategies
4. Parental investment differs, affects strategy preferences
5. Men constrained by access to fertile women
6. Men's problems: partner quantity, sexual accessibility, minimizing commitment
7. Women's problems: identifying resourceful men, commitment, parenting skills, protection
8. Different evolved sexual strategies for men and women

### Critique Framework (Fayyaz, 2019)

**Five Major Critiques:**
1. **Overemphasis on male promiscuity** - Contradicts own long-term mating stance
2. **Ignoring cooperative nature** - Treats strategies independently, not as teamwork
3. **Cultural context omission** - No consideration of cultural variations
4. **Emotional factors neglected** - Love, guilt, jealousy as commitment devices
5. **Hasty generalization** - Paints everyone with same brush, ignores variation

## Evidence Base

### Biological Evidence

**Male Anatomy:**
- Smaller testes than chimps
- Less sperm production
- Slower sperm replacement
- Less vigorous sperm
- Lower sperm quality
- Lower ejaculation rates
→ Indicates fitness for monogamy, not multi-male/female mating

**Sperm Competition:**
- Human males recognize biological limitations
- Monogamy reduces sperm competition pressure
- Evolutionary shift toward long-term strategy

### Anthropological Evidence

**Prehistoric Hominins:**
- **Australopithecus afarensis** - Initially polygynous, shifted to monogamy during Homo erectus era
- **Neanderthals** - Monogamous mating within clans before European migration; male protection of mates
- **Homo erectus** - Monogamy as norm for kinship support
- **Homo sapiens** - Evolved to patrilocal mating, social monogamy as environmental adaptation

**Eusocial Evidence:**
- Mating with single male ancestral for all 8 independent eusocial lineages
- Supports inclusive fitness theory
- Monogamy critical for eusociality evolution

### Cultural Evidence

**Matriarchal Societies:**
- Mosuo (Tibetan Buddhists) - Women have multiple partners, children belong to mothers
- Post-colonial African societies - Matriarchal kinship, women as life-givers
- No gender hierarchy, both valued for reproduction

**Polygamous Societies:**
- 82% of cultures permit polygamy
- Legal in: South Africa, Egypt, Eritrea, Morocco, Malaysia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Israel
- Common in Muslim communities West Africa, Arab nations
- Status marker in Eastern cultures vs. offense in Western cultures

**Monogamy Dominance:**
- Despite legal polygamy, monogamy remains dominant marital arrangement
- Western cultural/legal frameworks enforce monogamy
- Eastern cultures: polygamy legal but not universal practice

### Emotional/Philosophical Evidence

**Ancient Philosophers:**
- Diotima: Desire for everlasting goodness, not beauty
- Aristophanes: Seek mythic wholeness, not just reproduction
- Socrates, Plato: Deep interest in romantic/emotional aspects

**Modern Research:**
- Haselton & Ketelaar (2005): Love changes perception
- Frank (1988): Guilt as commitment device
- Romantic love blocks alternative partners
- Love facilitates monogamy even in polygamous cultures

## Assessment

**Overall Quality:** Medium-High  
**Theoretical Contribution:** High (critical analysis of SST with alternative framework)  
**Empirical Support:** Low (theoretical synthesis, not original research)  
**Dissertation Relevance:** Very High (particularly for Chapters 1, 3, 9)  

**Recommendation:** 
Use as **critical counterpoint** to establish that even within evolutionary psychology, there are debates about male promiscuity, monogamy evolution, and the role of culture/emotions. Excellent for showing limitations of adaptationist thinking and supporting argument that contemporary crisis stems from mismatch between evolved monogamous adaptations and modern short-term environment.

**Final Note:**
This paper provides valuable cultural and emotional perspectives often missing from evolutionary psychology. While not empirically robust, it synthesizes important critiques and evidence challenging SST orthodoxy. Particularly valuable for dissertation's argument that modern mating crisis involves breakdown of evolved cooperative pair-bonding mechanisms.
