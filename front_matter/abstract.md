# Abstract

The contemporary Western world faces a paradox: what should be a golden age for human pair bonding has instead witnessed relationship satisfaction and stability reach historic lows. Despite unprecedented access to potential partners through digital technology and expanded social networks, relationship formation rates continue to decline, correlating with plummeting birth rates across Western societies. This dissertation argues that the crisis of modern commitment cannot be resolved by reductionist models that treat mate value or relationship satisfaction as single, undifferentiated constructs.

This research presents a novel four-dimensional integrative framework for understanding long-term pair bonding, termed the **Integrated Pair Bond Model**. The framework synthesizes insights from evolutionary psychology, Jungian analytical psychology, synchronicity theory, and transpersonal psychology to explain how sustainable partnerships require successful navigation across four interdependent dimensions: (1) **Evolutionary/Biological** foundations rooted in sexual selection and parental investment; (2) **Sociological/Environmental** factors including contemporary evolutionary mismatch; (3) **Depth Psychological** processes of individuation and shadow integration; and (4) **Transpersonal/Psychoid** resonance encompassing synchronistic phenomena and consciousness-level compatibility.

The dissertation employs an interdisciplinary methodology integrating empirical findings from evolutionary psychology (Buss, 2023; Bertrand et al., 2023), Jungian depth psychology (Jung, 1946/1954), and emerging research on quantum biological processes in human consciousness (Fayyaz, 2019; Limar, 2011). Key contributions include: (a) theoretical unification of biological and transpersonal dimensions of mate selection; (b) empirical documentation of hypergamous mate preferences through Norwegian register data analysis; (c) application of Jungian anima/animus projection theory to explain persistent mate choice patterns; and (d) speculative integration of quantum coherence in DNA as a potential mechanism for transpersonal compatibility.

This work distinguishes itself by proposing that long-term pair bond stability hinges on the conscious transition from unconscious, projection-based selection to a relationship that serves as a crucible for psychological growth and individuation. The framework offers both theoretical advancement in understanding human pair bonding and practical applications for addressing contemporary relationship challenges in an era of evolutionary mismatch.
