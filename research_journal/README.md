# Research Journal

This folder contains raw thinking, brainstorming, and freeform notes for the dissertation. These entries are processed by AI to extract structured insights for formal chapters.

## Organization

Entries are organized by:
- **Date:** `YYYY-MM-DD_topic.md`
- **Theme:** Tagged by chapter/topic in entry metadata

## Workflow

1. **Write freely** - Capture ideas without worrying about structure
2. **Tag entries** - Note which chapter/theme they relate to
3. **AI extraction** - Periodically request AI to summarize and organize
4. **Integration** - Move structured summaries to `notes/integration_notes/`
