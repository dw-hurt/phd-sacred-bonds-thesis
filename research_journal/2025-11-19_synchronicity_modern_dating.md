# Synchronicity in Modern Dating Apps

**Theme/Chapter:** Chapter 4 - Synchronicity  
**Status:** Draft

## Raw Ideas

I've been thinking about how people describe "fate" when they meet 
on dating apps. They say things like "we matched at just the right time" 
or "if I had swiped 5 minutes earlier I would have missed them."

This sounds exactly like Jung's synchronicity - acausal meaningful 
coincidence. But is it really acausal if an algorithm put them there?

Maybe the algorithm is the modern psychoid dimension? The algorithm 
"knows" something about compatibility that neither person consciously 
knows. It's like the collective unconscious operating through code.

Counter-argument: This could just be confirmation bias. People 
remember the "meaningful" matches and forget the random ones.

But wait - what if synchronicity operates THROUGH probability? 
Jung never said synchronicity was supernatural, just acausal in 
terms of mechanical causation...

## Key Concepts

- Dating apps as modern psychoid dimension
- Algorithm as unconscious matchmaker
- Synchronicity operating through probability
- User narratives of "fate" and "timing"
- Distinction between causal (algorithm) and acausal (meaning)

## Questions to Explore

- How does Jung define "acausal" vs. random chance?
- Are there studies on how people narrativize app matches?
- Can synchronicity operate through technological mediation?
- What would Buss say about "fate" narratives - adaptive?
