## Stage 2: Integration 🟡 IN PROGRESS

**Status:** 35% Complete  
**Overall Health:** 🟡 Partial - Need Archetypal/Transpersonal Balance  

### Purpose
Extract quotes, organize by chapter, identify cross-references, begin connecting ideas across dimensions.

### Completion Criteria
- ✅ Quote database structure created
- ✅ Chapter 2 quotes extracted (biological foundation)
- ⏳ Chapter 3 quotes extracted (archetypal framework)
- ⏳ Chapter 4 quotes extracted (synchronicity)
- ⏳ Chapter 5 quotes extracted (transpersonal dimensions)
- ⏳ Cross-dimensional mappings documented
- ⏳ Integration notes created for each dimension

### Current Progress

| Chapter | Theme | Quotes Extracted | Target | Status |
|---------|-------|------------------|--------|--------|
| Ch 2 | Biological/Evolutionary | 28 | 25-30 | ✅ Complete |
| Ch 3 | Archetypal/Jungian | 0 | 20-25 | 🔴 Blocked |
| Ch 4 | Synchronicity | 0 | 15-20 | 🔴 Blocked |
| Ch 5 | Transpersonal | 0 | 15-20 | 🔴 Blocked |
| Ch 6 | Contemporary Crisis | 0 | 20-25 | ⏳ Pending |
| Ch 7 | Synthesis | 0 | 30-40 | ⏳ Pending |
| **TOTAL** | | **28** | **~150** | **19%** |

### Integration Activities Completed
- ✅ Created quote database structure (`quotes/by_chapter/`)
- ✅ Created source summary repository (`notes/reading_notes/by_source/`)
- ✅ Established citation format (BibTeX with Zotero)
- ✅ Linked quotes to specific chapters
- ✅ Created README navigation for GitBook

### Integration Activities Pending
- ⏳ Map biological concepts to archetypal patterns (Ch 2 → Ch 3 bridge)
- ⏳ Identify synchronicity examples in evolutionary research (Ch 2 → Ch 4 bridge)
- ⏳ Document transpersonal emergence points (Ch 2 → Ch 5 bridge)
- ⏳ Create cross-reference index
- ⏳ Build integration notes for each dimensional pair

### Blockers / Issues
- 🔴 **Critical Blocker:** Chapters 3, 4, 5 have no source material yet
  - **Impact:** Cannot complete integration until archetypal/transpersonal sources processed
  - **Resolution:** Prioritize Jungian/Synchronicity/Transpersonal sources in Stage 1
- ⚠️ **Imbalance:** Heavy emphasis on biological dimension (2 sources, 28 quotes) vs. zero archetypal
  - **Risk:** Dissertation may over-emphasize evolutionary psychology at expense of thesis novelty
  - **Mitigation:** Process minimum 2 Jungian sources before proceeding to Stage 3

### Tools & Workflow
- **Quote Extraction:** Manual review of summaries + AI assistance
- **Storage Format:** Markdown with metadata (quote text, source, page, relevance notes)
- **Organization:** By chapter (`quotes/by_chapter/chapter_0X_quotes.md`)
- **Cross-referencing:** Manual tagging + integration notes

### Writing Infrastructure Ready
- ✅ Chapter templates created for all 8 chapters
- ✅ `writing_session.ps1` script configured
- ✅ `daily_progress.ps1` script for tracking
- ✅ Citation guide (`citation_guide.md`) available
- ✅ Git workflow automated
- ✅ GitBook interface for writing/review

### Recommended Writing Sequence
1. **Chapter 1 (Introduction)** - Can start immediately
   - **Rationale:** Sets research questions and framework, minimal citations needed
   - **Dependencies:** None
   - **Target Start:** This week

2. **Chapter 2 (Evolutionary Foundation)** - Can start immediately
   - **Rationale:** All material ready (28 quotes, 2 comprehensive sources)
   - **Dependencies:** None
   - **Target Start:** After Chapter 1, Section 1 complete

3. **Chapter 3-5 (Archetypal/Synchronicity/Transpersonal)** - Blocked
   - **Rationale:** Zero source material currently
   - **Dependencies:** Stage 2 integration for these chapters
   - **Target Start:** After processing Jungian/synchronicity/transpersonal sources

4. **Chapter 6-8** - Dependent on 2-5
   - **Rationale:** Synthesis chapters require content from earlier chapters
   - **Dependencies:** Substantial drafts of Chapters 2-5
   - **Target Start:** Mid-to-late Stage 3

### Blockers / Issues
- 🔴 **Critical:** 75% of chapters blocked by missing source material
- **Resolution Path:**
  1. Start with Chapters 1 and 2 (unblocked)
  2. Process Jungian sources in parallel
  3. Unlock Chapter 3 writing once Jungian integration complete
  4. Repeat for Chapters 4-5

### Daily Workflow (Once Started)
```
1. Navigate: phd
2. Sync: git pull
3. Start Session: writing_session
4. Write: 2-4 hours in target chapter file
5. Track Progress: daily_progress
6. Commit: git add . && git commit -m "Chapter X progress"
7. Push: git push
```

### Tools & Workflow
- **Writing Environment:** VSCode (local) + GitBook (review)
- **Format:** Markdown with inline citations `[@author2023key]`
- **Quote Integration:** Copy from `quotes/by_chapter/` files
- **Progress Tracking:** `daily_progress.ps1` updates word counts
- **Version Control:** Git commits after each session

## 🎯 Current Stage Focus: Stage 2 → Stage 3 Transition

**Immediate Priorities:**
1. **Complete Stage 2 for Archetypal Dimension** (Chapters 3-5)
   - Process 2-3 Jungian sources
   - Extract 15-20 quotes for Chapter 3
   - Process synchronicity and transpersonal sources

2. **Begin Stage 3 with Unblocked Chapters**
   - Start Chapter 1 drafting (Introduction)
   - Begin Chapter 2 drafting (Evolutionary Foundation)

**Transition Strategy:**
- **Parallel Processing:** Write Chapters 1 & 2 while processing archetypal sources
- **Risk Mitigation:** Don't wait for all sources before writing; start with available material
- **Quality Control:** Ensure minimum 2 Jungian sources before claiming archetypal framework is established

---

**Notes:**
- Stage status updated weekly during weekly review
- Health indicators: 🟢 On Track | 🟡 Partial Progress | 🔴 Blocked | ⚪ Not Started
- Transition between stages is fluid; overlap is expected and encouraged
